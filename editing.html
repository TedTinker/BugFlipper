<h1>Customizing BugFlipper</h1>
  
<p>Choosing folders each time the GIMP is opened can be a tedious process. Save time by changing the default settings.

<p>BugFlipper.py may be opened in most text editors including Notepad and TextWrangler. For changes to the code to take effect, the changes must be saved before the GIMP is opened. </p>

<p>The default settings are specified in the register() function at the bottom of the plug-in, pictured below. The first seven items are standardized and outline some general information about the code. The following empty "" tells the GIMP that the plug-in does not require an image to be open; the plug-in will open images on its own.</p>

<p>The square brackets contain the more useful options and their defaults. Each of the nine options has the following form:</p>
  
<p>(PF_SOMETHING, "variable name", "display text", default, optional list)</p>
  
<p>Changing the value of the item in the position labeled default will change the initial value of the option specified. For example, changing</p>
  
<p>(PF_DIRNAME, "OldDir", "Folder with photos (click other to browse):","C:\\") to (PF_DIRNAME, "OldDir", "Folder with photos (click other to browse):","C:\\Users\\Username\\Pictures\\inputfolder")</p>
  
<p>would save time if the plug-in was consistantly used to process images from that folder. Notice that each backslash has to be repeated, because backslashes are special characters.</p>
