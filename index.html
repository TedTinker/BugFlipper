<h1>About</h1>
  
<p>The Zoologists at UCSB's Cheadle Center for Biodiversity and Ecological Restoration (CCBER) take photos of their entomological specimens for upload to CCBER databases. These photos require processing before they are ready to upload. Some processing tasks required would be difficult to automate using traditional keyboard macros and batch-editing software.</p>

<p>BugFlipper.py was written as a plug-in for the GNU Image Manipulation Program (GIMP) to streamline this photo-editing process. The plug-in allows users to select a folder of images, automatically perform image-processing tasks on each image, and display the images one at a time for editing by hand. One feature which has proven particularly helpful at Cheadle Center is the option to rename photos based on a QR code contained within each photo, expedited by a hand-held 2D scanner.</p>
  
<p>BugFlipper is Free-Ware, which means anyone may download it, use it, edit it, and even distribute it. Click <a href="editing">Customizing BugFlipper</a> for instructions on changing the default settings.
