<p>The plug-in Bug-Flipper should function on any operating system which can run its required components, but has been written and tested specifically in Windows 7, 10 and Sierra. Referenced links are at the end of each installation guide (more recent versions of Python and the GIMP may be used with semi-reliability):</p>
